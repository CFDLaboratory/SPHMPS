# SPHMPS
SPHMPS (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Multiphysics Solver) is a multifunctional software package developed in FORTRAN and at the current version, it is able to solve all kinds of two-dimensional nonisothermal structure-structure and fluid-structure interaction problems based on the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics method.
